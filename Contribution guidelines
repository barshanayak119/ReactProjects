- Make a folder containing the React Js Project.
- Run the project on your local host or any public domain and take a screenshot of the webpage.
- Make a description file describing about your react project.
- Add the screenshot and the description file to your project folder.
- Create a pull request to add that folder.
Wait for some time , drink some coffee☕, give your self a break(you deserve it)😜.
